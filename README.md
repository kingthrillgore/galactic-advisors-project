# Project Notes

This is a test project intended during an interview. Plagarising this project for your own nefarious goals is a no-no and will get you in trouble ðŸ™‚

## Running the thing

* Start the backend in that directory `node app.js`.
* Start the frontend in that directory `npm run dev`.
* Have fun.

## Time Spent

2h on Sunday 12 Nov 2023 over at least four half hour sprints.

## Things I wanted to do:

* Use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) instead of `fetch()`.
